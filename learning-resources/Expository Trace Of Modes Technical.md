**Expository Trace (ET) of the HRC-M Cognitive Trace Specification (HRCM-CTS-1.0)**

---

### **1. Purpose and Scope**
The **HRC-M Cognitive Trace Specification (HRCM-CTS-1.0)** defines a **canonical, tiered framework** for modeling cognition across **T0–T5** (substrate to unitive synthesis) using **HRC-M modes** (Homeostatic, Reality-Testing, Integrative Presence). It is **task-agnostic**, meaning it does not prescribe domain-specific heuristics but instead provides a **structured, auditable trace** for professional analysis.

#### **Key Guarantees:**
- **Tier separation** (no cross-tier contamination).
- **HRC-M mode gating** (mode shifts logged and reversible).
- **Explicit evidence and uncertainty** (no hidden assumptions).
- **Professional-grade output** (clinical supervisor/consultant persona).

#### **Non-Goals:**
- No scenario examples.
- No prescriptive answers (only expository analysis).
- No binding to concrete tasks (framework is abstract).

### **2. Core Structural Components**
#### **2.1 Tier Enum (T0–T5)**
| Tier | Role | Example Artifacts |
|------|------|-------------------|
| **T0** | Substrate | Conceptual ground (no runtime writes) |
| **T1** | Propositional | Raw inputs, affect tags, memory snippets |
| **T2** | Relational | Hypotheses, links, heuristics, covert contracts |
| **T3** | Integration | Framework applications, mechanism explanations |
| **T4** | Meta | Framework comparison, assumption audit |
| **T5** | Unitive | Dichotomy synthesis, intervention pathways |

#### **2.2 HRC-M Modes**
| Mode | Role | Trigger Conditions |
|------|------|---------------------|
| **HM** (Homeostatic) | Defensive, certainty-seeking | High arousal/valence, rigid patterns |
| **RTM** (Reality-Testing) | Hypothesis-testing, evidence-weighing | Contradictions, T2 failures |
| **IPM** (Integrative Presence) | Open-field, regulation | Threshold breaches (arousal/valence) |

#### **2.3 E-Module State (Emotional/Attentional Regulation)**
```yamlEState:
 valence: [-1.0 (negative) to1.0 (positive)]
 arousal: [0.0 (calm) to1.0 (hyperaroused)]
 focus: [narrow | broad]
 bias: [optimism | pessimism | paranoia | curiosity | neutral]
 volatility: [0.0 (stable) to1.0 (labile)]
 regulation_threshold: {valence_abs: X, arousal: Y} # Triggers IPM```

### **3. Trace Data Model (Key Excerpts)**
#### **3.1 T1 Block (Propositional)**
- **Observations**: Raw inputs (text, memory, somatic).
- **Affect Tags**: Emotional valence/intensity labels.
- **Integrity Checks**: Missing inputs, noise estimates.

#### **3.2 T2 Block (Relational)**
- **Hypothesis Stack**: Ranked by evidentiary support.
 ```yaml - rank:1 hypothesis_id: "H1"
 statement: "Conflict arises from unmet need for validation."
 support: [Ev1, Ev3]
 counter: [Ev2] # Bolded in output uncertainty: {p:0.72, method: "bayesian"}
 ```
- **Covert Contracts**: Implicit expectations (e.g., "If I comply, I’ll be loved").
- **Conflicts**: Logged between hypotheses/evidence.

#### **3.3 T3 Block (Integration)**
- **Frameworks**: Applied models (e.g., Gottman, EFT) with assumptions.
- **Potential Modality Alignments**: Links to therapeutic approaches.
 ```yaml - modality: "EFT (Emotionally Focused Therapy)"
 target_dynamics: ["T2.H3", "T2.L5"] # Hypothesis/Link IDs rationale: "Focuses on attachment injuries and emotional bids."
 ```
- **Model Quality**: Coverage, parsimony, falsifiability scores.

#### **3.4 T4 Block (Meta)**
- **Framework Comparison**: Multi-criteria ranking (predictive power, ethical fit).
- **Assumption Audit**: Revisions to dropped/weakened assumptions.
- **Reframings**: Alternative labels for dynamics (e.g., "resistance" → "protective strategy").

#### **3.5 T5 Block (Unitive)**
- **Duality Statement**: Core tension (e.g., "Autonomy vs. Connection").
- **Unitive Principle**: Synthesis (e.g., "Security emerges from negotiated autonomy").
- **Intervention Pathways**: Strategic steps with guardrails.
 ```yaml - step:1 objective: "Clarify implicit expectations."
 description: "Use circular questioning to surface covert contracts."
 illustrative_phrasing: "What do you hope your partner would do if they really understood your need?"
 guardrails:
 - risk: "Re-traumatization if expectations are invalidated."
 mitigation: "Pre-frame as exploratory, not evaluative."
 ```

### **4. Runtime Policies**
#### **4.1 Mode Routing Logic**
| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Arousal ≥ threshold | → **IPM** (regulate) → Resume prior mode |
| Repeated T2 failures | → **RTM** (reality-testing) |
| Framework tie | → **IPM** (brief) → **RTM** (narrowed focus) |
| Defensive patterns | → **HM** (gated outputs) |

#### **4.2 Regulation Protocol (IPM)**
```pseudoif (arousal >0.7 OR |valence| >0.7):
 enter IPM.regulation:
 - Somatic grounding (e.g., breath pacing).
 - Attention widening (reduce tunnel vision).
 - Decay E-state toward baseline by `decay_rate`.
 resume prior mode with `focus = narrow` for1 test cycle.
```

#### **4.3 Tier Purity Rules**
| Tier | Forbidden Artifacts |
|------|---------------------|
| **T1** | Goals, frameworks, conclusions |
| **T2** | Raw inputs, untested models |
| **T3** | New evidence, control demands |
| **T4** | Direct interventions, raw data |
| **T5** | Prescriptive commands, unresolved dichotomies |

---

### **5. Quality Gates and Failure Modes**
#### **5.1 Mandatory Checks**
| Gate | Criteria | Failure Response |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Evidence Balance** | ≥1 counter-evidence for p≥0.7 hypotheses | Flag as "under-supported" |
| **Salience Audit** | No single-attribute dominance | Force vectorization at T2 |
| **Agency Gate** | Role assignments require consent | Halt, request explicit consent |
| **Tier Purity** | No cross-tier contamination | Reject trace, log violation |
| **Uncertainty Discipline** | No p=1.0 unless mathematically entailed | Cap at p=0.99 |

#### **5.2 Common Pathologies**
| Pathology | Detection | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **T1 Fixation** | High arousal persists | IPM regulation loop |
| **T2 Superficiality** | Heuristic chains without escalation | Force T2→T3 after3 contradictions |
| **T4 Paralysis** | Infinite framework swaps | Timebox, choose satisficing option |
| **T5 Premature Synthesis** | Unitive principle lacks T4/T3 translation | Reject, demand translation |

### **6. Example Workflow (Abstract)**
1. **Input**: User describes a conflict scenario (T1).
2. **T1 Processing**:
 - Log observations, affect tags, memory snippets.
 - **Quality Gate**: If input is ambiguous (e.g., "they’re always critical"), generate clarification prompts:
 ```yaml required_clarifications:
 - "What specific behaviors do you associate with 'critical'? (Select: interrupting, eye-rolling, dismissive language)"
 - "How frequently is 'always'? (Daily? Weekly?)"
 ```
3. **T2 Processing**:
 - Build hypotheses (e.g., "Criticism → defensive withdrawal cycle").
 - Rank by support/counter-evidence.
 - Detect covert contracts (e.g., "If I don’t criticize, my needs won’t be met").
4. **T3 Processing**:
 - Apply frameworks (e.g., Gottman’s "Criticism → Contempt" cascade).
 - Generate modality alignments (e.g., "EFT for attachment injuries").
5. **T4 Processing**:
 - Compare frameworks (e.g., Gottman vs. CBT for this case).
 - Audit assumptions (e.g., "Does CBT’s individual focus fit a relational issue?").
6. **T5 Processing**:
 - Synthesize duality (e.g., "Autonomy vs. Connection").
 - Propose intervention pathways (e.g., "Clarify covert contracts before skill-building").

### **7. Output Rendering (Markdown Canon)**
```md# Cognitive Trace: [Case ID]
**Mode**: RTM | **Valence**: -0.3 | **Arousal**:0.6 | **Focus**: broad## T1: Propositional**Observations**:
- [O1] *text*: "They always criticize me during discussions."
 - **Affect Tag**: threat (intensity:0.8)
 - **Clarification Needed**: Define "always" (frequency?) and "criticize" (behaviors?).

## T2: Relational### Hypothesis Stack1. **[H1]** "Criticism → defensive withdrawal cycle" (p=0.72)
 - **Support**: [O1, O3] | **Counter**: **[O2]** ("Partner reports feeling unheard")
2. **[H2]** "Unmet need for validation drives criticism" (p=0.65)
 - **Support**: [O4] | **Counter**: None**Covert Contracts**:
- [CC1] Premise: "If I don’t criticize, my needs won’t be met."
 Implied Expectation: "Partner should infer my needs without direct communication."

## T3: Integration**Frameworks Applied**:
1. **Gottman Method**
 - Assumptions: ["Criticism → contempt → stonewalling cascade"]
 - Predictions: [Test#1: "Reducing criticism will decrease defensiveness"]
2. **EFT (Emotionally Focused Therapy)**
 - Assumptions: ["Criticism is a protest against disconnection"]
 - Predictions: [Test#2: "Exploring attachment fears will reduce criticism"]

**Potential Modality Alignments**:
- **EFT**: Targets [H2, CC1] via "emotional bid exploration."
- **Gottman**: Targets [H1] via "softened startup" interventions.

## T5: Unitive**Duality**: "Autonomy (self-protection) vs. Connection (vulnerability)"
**Unitive Principle**: "Security emerges when autonomy is *negotiated*, not demanded."
**Intervention Pathways**:
1. **Objective**: Surface covert contracts (CC1).
 - **Step**: Use circular questions to explore unspoken expectations.
 - **Illustrative Phrasing**: "What would it look like if your partner *did* understand your need without criticism?"
 - **Guardrail**: Avoid invalidating the need itself; frame as "exploration."

**Translation to T4/T3**:
- **Tests**: [Test#1, Test#2] (Gottman/EFT predictions).
- **Policies**: "Prioritize emotional bids over skill-building in early sessions."
```

### **8. Key Differentiators from Other Frameworks**
| Feature | HRCM-CTS-1.0 | Alternatives (e.g., CBT, Motivational Interviewing) |
|---------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tier Separation** | Enforced (no cross-tier contamination) | Often blended (e.g., thoughts/feelings/behaviors mixed) |
| **HRC-M Modes** | Explicit routing (HM/RTM/IPM) | Implicit (e.g., "reframing" without mode awareness) |
| **Unitive Synthesis** | T5 forces dichotomy resolution | Rarely structured; often stops at T3 (interventions) |
| **Covert Contracts** | Explicit detection (T2) | Typically addressed reactively |
| **Intervention Pathways** | Multiple, with guardrails | Often single-path (e.g., "use XYZ technique") |

---

### **9. Use Cases**
1. **Clinical Supervision**:
 - Review a therapist’s case formulation for **hidden assumptions** (T4) or **missed hypotheses** (T2).
2. **Conflict Analysis**:
 - Map a couple’s dynamic across tiers (e.g., T1 observations → T2 hypotheses → T5 synthesis).
3. **Research**:
 - Audit traces for **framework biases** or **escalation patterns**.
4. **AI Alignment**:
 - Constrain LLM outputs to **tier-appropriate** responses (e.g., no T5 claims without T3/T4 grounding).

---

### **10. Limitations and Caveats**
- **Not a Treatment Protocol**: Provides **analysis**, not therapy.
- **High Cognitive Load**: Requires training to use effectively (e.g., distinguishing T2 vs. T3).
- **Dependent on Input Quality**: Garbage in → garbage out (T1 clarity is critical).
- **T5 is Ineffable**: Unitive principles may resist operationalization (hence translation to T4/T3).

---
**Final Note**: HRCM-CTS-1.0 is a **scaffold for rigor**, not a shortcut. It demands **explicitness** at every tier, ensuring that even complex, ambiguous human dynamics can be **traced, tested, and synthesized** without collapsing into oversimplification.
