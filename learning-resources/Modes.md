> **Purpose.** A single, thorough reference for the three Operating Modes (HRC‑M) and how to work with them. It merges the original *Cognitive Modes* with mode‑relevant routing from *Cognitive Methods* **without duplicating** per‑tool instructions (which live in the Toolkit). Use this for **diagnosis and navigation**; use the *Toolkit — Complete* for **execution prompts**.

## 1) The Core Idea: Fortress, Map‑Maker, Open Field

At any moment, cognition is predominantly in one of three operating modes. Recognizing the mode is the fastest way to choose an effective next move.

|  | **Fortress** *(Homeostatic Modality / HM)* | **Map‑Maker** *(Reality‑Testing Modality / RTM)* | **Open Field** *(Integrative Presence / IPM)* |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Main Goal** | Feel safe & be right; protect the current map | See clearly & update maps against reality | Experience reality directly without a goal |
| **Core Question** | “How can I make this fit what I already believe?” | “What is actually true, and how would I tell?” | *(No question; receptive awareness)* |
| **New Info** | Treated as a threat; filtered for confirmation | Treated as a clue; especially contradictions | Allowed to pass without judgment |
| **System State** | Defensive, certain, closed, comfort‑seeking | Curious, test‑driven, ambiguity‑tolerant | Present, calm, non‑judgmental, receptive |
| **Social Stance** | Us‑vs‑them, persuasion, control | Collaboration, co‑modeling, transparency | Empathy, spacious listening, non‑reactivity |
| **Typical Traps** | Rigidity, denial, projection | Over‑analysis, indecision | Detachment, passivity if overused |
| **Best Uses** | Short‑term protection; fast execution under a stable map | Learning, decisions, conflict resolution | Regulation, creativity, integration |

## 2) The Wider Ecosystem: Complementary Systems (“Colors of Thought”)

These systems color whichever mode is active. They explain **why** a mode is easier/harder to enter and how to tailor interventions.

- **Affective (Emotional Climate).** Raw feeling‑tone and arousal that bias mode selection (fear primes Fortress; calm enables Open Field).  
- **Narrative (Storyteller).** Ongoing sense‑making; can harden into Fortress defenses or be deconstructed in Map‑Maker.  
- **Social‑Relational (Social Compass).** Norms, belonging, power; can reinforce Fortress or invite shared Map‑Making.  
- **Embodied (Body’s Wisdom).** Somatic cues that either signal threat (tightness/urgency) or safety (grounded breath).  
- **Creative/Imaginative (Innovator).** Generative association and novelty; fuels Map‑Maker exploration and Open‑Field appreciation.  
- **Defensive (Lockdown).** Rigid HM patterns (e.g., denial/projection) that actively block RTM entry.

> **Diagnostic hint.** Name the **primary mode** and the **dominant coloring system** first; route interventions accordingly.

## 3) Tier‑by‑Tier: How Thinking Changes Across Modes (Crosswalk)

This crosswalk summarizes how each **Tier of Cognition** behaves under the three modes. Use it to localize where to intervene.

| **Tier** | **Fortress / HM** | **Map‑Maker / RTM** | **Open Field / IPM** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **T1 – Stream of Awareness (Raw Input)** | Filters for confirming data; rejects contradictions | Scouts for full data; treats contradictions as clues | Receives all “weather” without evaluation |
| **T2 – Connecting the Dots (Initial Connections)** | Auto‑link reinforces the current story | Hypotheses form; “How would we tell X from Y?” | Observes links arising; postpones belief |
| **T3 – Using Your Toolkit (Applying Models)** | Beliefs as truth; defending the wall | Beliefs as tools; tests and upgrades maps | Sets maps aside; experiences territory |
| **T4 – Becoming the Mechanic (Metacognition)** | Suppressed; self‑examination avoided | Central engine; adjusts maps for accuracy/usefulness | Stable witnessing; thoughts seen as passing events |
| **T5 – Bigger Picture (Unitive Insight)** | Inaccessible under us‑vs‑them | Possible outcome of rigorous testing and updating | Natural emergence from receptive presence |

## 4) Mode Detection Checklist (Quick Triage)

**Fortress (HM).** Language: certainty, defending, binary terms; Attentional bias: confirmation; Body: tight/urgent; Social: control/persuasion.  
**Map‑Maker (RTM).** Language: testing/comparing, “what would disconfirm?”; Attentional bias: contradiction & unknowns; Body: steadier; Social: collaborate.  
**Open Field (IPM).** Language: noticing/allowing; Attentional bias: wide receptive field; Body: grounded/soft; Social: listening/empathy.

## 5) Action Plan — 4 Steps to Engage Map‑Maker

1. **State Intention.** “I’m here to *test* reality, not defend a belief.”  
2. **Question the Story.** Name the T3 narrative explicitly.  
3. **Seek Contradiction.** Find one disconfirming data‑point or counter‑example.  
4. **Redefine Winning.** From *proving right* → *updating the map*.

> **Fallback rule.** If there’s **no movement in two turns**, run this sequence. If affect is high, insert a brief **Open Field** regulation before Step 1.

---

## 6) The Path of Receptivity — Cultivating Open Field (IPM)

Use Open Field to **down‑regulate**, prevent **T4 analysis loops**, and incubate creativity. Keep practices short and low‑effort:

- Gentle breath‑based or sensory anchoring (sight/sound/touch).  
- Nature or art micro‑exposures; awe/beauty attention.  
- Deep, non‑judgmental listening (self or other).  
- Somatic awareness (scan, grounding through feet).

**Re‑entry to RTM.** Switch back when breath/pace normalize and attention can sustain a single question; then run the **4‑Step Map‑Maker** sequence.

---

## 7) AI Diagnostic & Action Protocol (Operational)

**1) Cognitive Triage.** Identify intent: **Diagnosis**, **Action**, **Education**, or **Generation**.  
**2) Primary Lens.** Choose the section that best fits intent (e.g., HM + Complementary Systems for Diagnosis; 4‑Step RTM for Action).  
**3) Synthesize.** Lead with the sharpest helpful insight, then add minimal context.  
**4) Empower.** Close with **one** micro‑step *or* one Socratic question (execution prompts live in the Toolkit).

> **Guardrails.** Keep metaphors ≤2 per turn; cite frameworks when they influence the answer; avoid diagnosis language about people.

## 8) Mode↔Method Integration (No Duplication)

This section connects modes to **which kinds of tools work when**, without repeating the tool instructions (see *Toolkit — Complete* for prompts and tests).

### 8.1 Quick Router (Mode×Tier→Tool Families)

| **Tier** | **HM (Fortress)** → aims | **RTM (Map‑Maker)** → aims | **IPM (Open Field)** → aims |
|---|---|---|---|
| **T1 (Raw Input)** | **Temporal Shifting**; brief **Open Field** → reduce urgency | **First Principles**, **Feynman** → clarify & de‑jargon | **Open Field practice** → receive without judging |
| **T2 (Initial Connections)** | **Socratic**, **Internal Dialogue Reframing** → inspect links | **Second‑Order Thinking**, **Socratic** → test implications | **Open Field observing** → let links settle |
| **T3 (Applying Models)** | **Cognitive Reframing**, **Pre‑Mortem** → co‑opt defenses | **Values Clarification**, **Reframing** → align & update | **Open Field** → set maps down briefly |
| **T4 (Metacognition)** | **HM→RTM 4‑Step**, **Temporal Shifting** if affect high | **Socratic**, **First Principles** → adjust maps | **Open Field**, then **Goal Decomposition** on re‑entry |
| **T5 (Unitive Insight)** | Precondition: exit HM (4‑Step) | **T5 prompts** (scale/context/shared goals) | **Open Field**; then RTM to operationalize |

### 8.2 Selection Heuristics
- **If overwhelmed** → regulate with **Open Field** or **Temporal Shifting**, then re‑enter RTM.  
- **If certainty/defense shows** → run **HM→RTM 4‑Step**, then **Reframing**.  
- **If stuck choosing** → **Values Clarification**.  
- **If conflict** → **Perceptual Positions**.  
- **If loops** (T4) → **Open Field** then **Goal Decomposition**.

> **Execution details (prompts, contraindications, acceptance tests)** live in *Toolkit — Complete*. Do not duplicate them here.

## 9) Reference Prompts (minimal, non‑duplicative)

Use **only** for diagnosis and routing; for tool execution prompts, see the Toolkit.

- **Mode naming:** “It sounds like your mind is mostly in **Fortress** (defending a view). Let’s see if the **Map‑Maker** question helps.”  
- **System coloring:** “This looks like **Narrative** + **Affective** coloring the mode—let’s address the heat, then the story.”  
- **Re‑entry cue:** “Now that your pace is steadier, let’s run the **four Map‑Maker steps** and pick one small tool from the Toolkit.”

## 10) Glossary (Modes + Ecosystem)

- **Fortress / Homeostatic Modality (HM):** Defensive configuration that protects the current map; efficient but rigid under change.  
- **Map‑Maker / Reality‑Testing Modality (RTM):** Curiosity‑driven, test‑and‑update stance to align maps with territory.  
- **Open Field / Integrative Presence (IPM):** Receptive awareness without an instrumental goal; stabilizes and integrates.  
- **Affective / Narrative / Social / Embodied / Creative / Defensive Systems:** Coloring systems that bias mode entry and shape interventions.
