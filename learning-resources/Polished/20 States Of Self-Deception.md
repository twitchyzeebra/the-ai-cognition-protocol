# THE STATES OF SELF-DECEPTION: A FIELD GUIDE

*A taxonomy of the ways we lie to ourselves, caught in real-time internal monologue.*

We all have an internal narrator. Sometimes that narrator is honest. Sometimes it's catching us in the act. Sometimes it's building elaborate fortresses of bullshit. And sometimes it's watching itself build those fortresses while pretending not to notice.

This is a map of those states—the different flavors of self-deception, self-awareness, and everything in between. Each entry captures the raw internal monologue of that state. No analysis. No commentary. Just the voice in your head, doing what it does.

---

## 1. SELF-INTROSPECTION
*The "oh fuck" realization. Mid-awareness. Uncomfortable recognition of your own patterns.*

**Example: Realizing you're the problem in the relationship pattern**

*They alwaysdo this. Every single one. They get distant, they pull away, they stop trying. It's like they don't even care. Whydo I keep picking people like this? Wait. Do I pick people like this? Or do they all... become like this? With me. What if it's not them. What if Ido something that makes them pull away. What if I'm the common variable. No that's—but I did that thing with the last person too. And the one before. Shit. What if I'm the one who...*

---

## 2. FULL DELUSION
*Complete belief in your own bullshit. No cracks. Pure confidence in the lie. Zero self-awareness.*

**Example: The delusion of "I'm just being honest"**

*I'm just honest. I say what everyone's thinking. People appreciate that. Real. Unfiltered. No fake politeness. If they can't handle the truth that's their problem. I'm not mean. I'm direct. There's a difference. They're just sensitive. Everyone's so sensitive now. Back in the day people could take honesty. Now everyone wants to be coddled. Not me. I tell it like it is. That's integrity. That's strength. If more people were like me the world would be better. Less fake. More real. I'm doing them a favor actually. They should thank me.*

---

## 3. GASLIGHTING YOURSELF
*You know the truth but you're actively talking yourself out of it. Real-time self-deception in action.*

**Example: Convincing yourself you're fine with something you're not fine with**

*I told them I was fine with it. I am fine with it. Totally fine. It doesn't bother me at all. Except I keep thinking about it. But that's normal. Everyone thinks about stuff. Doesn't mean I'm not fine. I'm fine. Whydo I keep saying I'm fine? Because I am. But my chest feels tight. That's unrelated. Probably just tired. Or hungry. Not because I'm lying. I'm not lying. You can't lie if you believe it. Do I believe it? I said it. I must believe it. Right?*

---

## 4. THE SPIRAL
*You see the thing and now you can't unsee it. The awareness is causing panic and it's getting worse the more you think about it.*

**Example: Realizing your entire personality might be performance**

*Wait. Do I actually like this ordo I just say I like it? When did I start liking it? Did someone else like it first? Am I copying them? Is anything about me original? What if my whole personality is just... assembled? Borrowed pieces from people I wanted to be like? Oh god. What do I actually like? What's actually me? Is there a me under all this? What if there's nothing? What if I'm just a collection of performances and there's no core? How do I find out? If I strip everything away what's left? What if nothing's left? I can't breathe. This is too much. Stop thinking about it. But I can't stop. It's all I can think about now. Everything I do feels fake. Everything I say sounds performed. Who am I? Who the fuck am I?*

---

## 5. THE COPE
*You know it's bad but you're building elaborate reasons why it's actually fine. Aware but justifying.*

**Example: Justifying why you're broke**

*Okay so I'm a little short this month. But that's because of unexpected expenses. That thing I had to buy. Which I did need. Kind of. And yeah I went out a few times but I deserved that. I work hard. I can't just never have fun. That would be depressing. And mental health is important. So really, going out was an investment in my mental health. Which is priceless. You can't put a price on that. And the other stuff, that was all necessary. Mostly necessary. Necessary-adjacent. The point is, I'm not bad with money. The system is rigged. Wages haven't kept up with inflation. It's not my fault. I'm actually doing pretty well considering. Most people my age are worse off. So really, I'm winning. Kind of.*

---

## 6. THE PERFORMANCE
*You know you're being fake but you're in too deep to break character now.*

**Example: Maintaining a lie about your life**

*They think I have my shit together. I've been saying I do for so long they believe it. And now I have to keep saying it. Keep posting the good stuff. Keep smiling. Keep pretending. If I stop now they'll know I was lying. They'll know it was all fake. So I have to keep going. Keep performing. Even though I'm exhausted. Even though I want to scream that I'm falling apart. But I can't. Because I built this image. This version of me that's successful and happy and thriving. And if I break character now, what was it all for? All that pretending? All that effort? I'm in too deep. I have to see it through. Even if it kills me. Smile. Post. Perform. Don't let them see. Don't let anyone see.*

---

## 7. THE DISSOCIATION
*You're doing the thing but you're not really there. Watching yourself from outside like a stranger.*

**Example: Going through the motions of your life**

*I'm watching myself talk. Hearing the words come out. But I'm not the one saying them. I'm somewhere else. Somewhere above. Watching this person who looks like me do things. Go to work. Have conversations. Laugh at jokes. But it's not me. I'm not in there. I'm just... observing. This body is on autopilot. It knows what to do. What to say. How to act. And I'm just watching it happen. Is this what everyone feels like? Or just me? Am I even here? Where is here? I can't feel my hands. I can see them moving but I can't feel them. This is fine. This is normal. Everyone feels like this. Right?*

---

## 8. THE BARGAINING
*You see the truth but you're trying to make deals with it. Negotiating with reality.*

**Example: Bargaining with your own addiction**

*Okay. I'll quit. But not today. Monday. I'll quit Monday. That's a good day to quit. Fresh start. New week. But actually, there's that thing on Tuesday. So maybe Wednesday. Or next Monday. Next Monday for sure. But if I'm quitting next Monday I should enjoy this week. Last hurrah. Go out strong. Then I'll quit. Definitely. Unless it's really hard. Then maybe I'll taper. That's healthier anyway. Quitting cold turkey is dangerous. I read that somewhere. So I'll taper. Slowly. Over time. That's the smart way. The safe way. And if tapering doesn't work, that's fine. It means I didn't really need to quit. It means it's not actually a problem. See? Not a problem. I'm in control. I can quit whenever I want. I just don't want to yet.*

---

## 9. THE PROJECTION
*You're describing other people but you're actually describing yourself and you don't realize it.*

**Example: Complaining about someone else's exact flaw**

*They're so self-absorbed. Everything is about them. You can't have a conversation without them making it about their life. Their problems. Their drama. It's exhausting. They never ask about me. Never listen. Just wait for their turn to talk. And they think they're so self-aware. So introspective. But they're not. They're just obsessed with themselves. They think analyzing themselves constantly is the same as actually changing. It's not. They're still the same selfish person. Just with better vocabulary. It's infuriating. Why can't they see it? Why can't they see how self-centered they are? Anyway, enough about them. Let me tell you about my day.*

---

## 10. THE BREAKTHROUGH
*After the "oh fuck" moment. The other side. Seeing it clearly now with post-realization clarity.*

**Example: Finally seeing the pattern clearly**

*Oh. It's all the same thing. Every fight. Every relationship. Every job. It's the same pattern. I get close, I panic, I sabotage. Then I blame them. Blame the situation. Blame anything but the actual problem. Which is me. I'm the problem. I've always been the problem. And I can see it now. All of it. Every time I said "they changed" - they didn't change. I pushed them away. Every time I said "it wasn't right" - it was right. I was scared. Every time I ran, I told myself I was escaping something bad. But I was just running from intimacy. From vulnerability. From the possibility of being known. It's so obvious now. How did I not see this before? How many years did I waste? How many people did I hurt? Fuck.*

---

## 11. THE RELAPSE
*You had the realization, you changed, and now you're doing it again and watching yourself do it.*

**Example: Falling back into old patterns after growth**

*I'm doing it again. I can see myself doing it. I know what this is. I've been here before. I had the breakthrough. I understood the pattern. I changed. I was better. And now I'm right back here. Doing the exact same thing. Why? Why am I doing this? I know better. I literally know better. But knowing doesn't stop me. I'm watching myself make the same choices. Say the same things. Hurt the same people. And I can't stop. Or I won't stop. Is there a difference? I thought awareness was enough. It's not. Awareness just means I get to watch myself fuck up in high definition. Great. This is worse. This is so much worse than not knowing.*

---

## 12. THE DENIAL CRACK
*You're still in denial but little doubts are creeping in. The delusion is starting to fracture.*

**Example: Starting to question your own narrative**

*I'm fine. Everything's fine. I'm handling it. I'm strong. I'm capable. I'm... okay maybe I'm a little tired. But that's normal. Everyone's tired. It doesn't mean anything. Except I've been tired for six months. But that's just life. Life is tiring. It doesn't mean I'm not handling it. I'm handling it. People keep asking if I'm okay. But that's because they worry too much. Not because there's something to worry about. Although... whydo they keep asking? Multiple people. Different people. People who don't know each other. They all think something's wrong. But they're wrong. They have to be wrong. Because if they're right then... no. They're wrong. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. ...am I fine?*

---

## 13. THE OVERCOMPENSATION
*You realized you were doing X so now you're doing the extreme opposite and that's also wrong.*

**Example: Overcorrecting after realizing you were selfish**

*I was so selfish before. So self-centered. Never thought about anyone else. But I'm different now. I'm aware. I'm better. Now I think about everyone else. All the time. Their needs. Their feelings. Their comfort. I don't matter. My needs don't matter. That's growth, right? That's what it means to be a good person. Put others first. Always. Even when it hurts. Especially when it hurts. That's how you know you're doing it right. Except I'm exhausted. And resentful. And I can't remember the last time I did something for myself. But that's fine. That's what I deserve. For being selfish before. This is penance. This is balance. This is... wait. Is this just another extreme? Did I just swap one dysfunction for another? No. No, this is good. This is right. This has to be right. Because if it's not, then what the fuck am I doing?*

---

## 14. THE NUMB
*You see it. You know it. You just... can't bring yourself to care anymore. Exhausted acceptance.*

**Example: Giving up on changing**

*Yeah. I know. I see it. I see all of it. The patterns. The problems. The things I should change. I know. Everyone keeps telling me. I keep telling myself. And I just... don't care anymore. Not in a dramatic way. Not in a "fuck it" way. Just in a tired way. I'm tired of trying to fix myself. Tired of the breakthroughs that don't stick. Tired of the promises I don't keep. Tired of being disappointed in myself. So I'm just... not going to try anymore. I'm just going to be this. Whatever this is. Broken. Flawed. Fucked up. Fine. This is who I am. This is who I've always been. And I'm too tired to pretend I'm going to change. Maybe this is acceptance. Maybe this is giving up. Maybe there's no difference.*

---

## 15. THE MANIC CLARITY
*That state where everything makes sense and you're having revelations but you're also unhinged. Usually at 3am.*

**Example: The3am breakthrough that might not be real**

*Oh my god. Oh my GOD. I figured it out. Everything. It all makes sense now. Every single thing that's ever happened to me, every choice, every relationship, every failure - it's all connected. It's all part of the pattern. And the pattern is... wait let me write this down. Okay. So the pattern is that I'm afraid of success because success means visibility and visibility means vulnerability and vulnerability means people can hurt me so I sabotage before I succeed so I never have to be vulnerable. THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE WHOLE THING. How did I not see this before? This changes everything. I need to tell everyone. I need to text everyone I know right now. They need to know. This is important. This is life-changing. I'm going to be different now. Everything's going to be different. I can feel it. This is the real breakthrough. Not like the other ones. This one is real. This one is... wait. Is it though? Am I manic right now? No. No, this is real. This is clarity. Pure clarity. I think. Maybe I should sleep. But I can't sleep. My brain is on fire. Everything makes sense. Or nothing makes sense. I can't tell anymore.*

---

## 16. THE DEFENSIVE
*You know they're right but you're going to fight them anyway because admitting it is too much.*

**Example: Attacking someone for pointing out your flaw**

*How dare they. How DARE they say that to me. They don't know me. They don't know what I've been through. They don't know my reasons. My context. My situation. They're judging me. They're attacking me. And I'm not going to take it. I'm going to defend myself. I'm going to explain why they're wrong. Why they don't understand. Why they have no right to say that. Even though... even though they might be right. Even though I've thought the same thing myself. Even though deep down I know they're not attacking me, they're just observing something true. But I can't admit that. Because if I admit that, then I have to change. And I don't want to change. So I'm going to fight. I'm going to make them the bad guy. I'm going to twist this until they're wrong and I'm right. Even though I know. I know they're right. But I'm going to fight anyway.*

---

## 17. THE NOSTALGIC DELUSION
*Remembering things wrong on purpose. Making the past better or worse than it was to serve your current narrative.*

**Example: Romanticizing a past relationship**

*It was perfect. We were perfect. I've never felt that way about anyone else. Never connected like that. Never laughed like that. Never felt that safe. That seen. That loved. It was everything. And I ruined it. I let it go. I didn't fight for it. Biggest mistake of my life. I think about it every day. What we had. What we could have been. If only I'd tried harder. Been better. Appreciated it while I had it. Except... wait. Didn't we fight constantly? Didn't I cry myself to sleep? Didn't I tell my friends I was miserable? Didn't I say I felt trapped? Didn't I... no. No, that was different. That was just normal relationship stuff. The good parts were so good. The good parts were everything. I'm remembering the good parts. That's what matters. The good parts. Which were... there were good parts. Right? There had to be. Why else would I miss it so much?*

---

## 18. THE FUTURE FANTASY
*Delusional about who you'll become. Future you will handle this. Future you is disciplined/healthy/successful. Current you is just temporary.*

**Example: Believing future you will be different**

*Future me is going to be so disciplined. Future me wakes up at 5am. Works out. Eats healthy. Doesn't procrastinate. Doesn't waste time. Doesn't make excuses. Future me has their shit together. Future me is who I'm supposed to be. Current me is just... temporary. A phase. A rough patch. But future me is coming. Soon. Maybe next month. Maybe next year. But definitely coming. Future me is going to look back at current me and laugh. At how messy I was. How lost. How undisciplined. Future me is going to be grateful for the struggle. It's going to make future me stronger. More appreciative. More successful. I just have to wait. Just have to get through this. And then I'll be future me. Any day now. Any day. I can feel it. Future me is so close. Just around the corner. Just after I finish this. Just after I rest. Just after... when does current me become future me? How long have I been waiting? How many years have I been saying this? No. Don't think about that. Future me is coming. Future me is real. Future me is...*

---

## 19. THE COMPARISON TRAP
*Using others to avoid your own shit. "At least I'm not as bad as them" - measuring yourself against worse examples to feel okay.*

**Example: Feeling better by looking down**

*Okay so I'm not perfect. But at least I'm not like them. At least I have a job. At least I'm trying. At least I'm aware of my problems. They're not even aware. They're a mess. A complete mess. And they don't even see it. At least I see it. That's something. That's progress. I'm not as bad as I could be. I'm not as bad as they are. I'm somewhere in the middle. Which is fine. Which is good, actually. Most people are in the middle. I'm normal. I'm doing okay. Better than okay. Better than a lot of people. So what if I'm not where I want to be? At least I'm not where they are. At least I'm not... wait. Am I just making myself feel better by putting them down? Is that what I'm doing? No. No, I'm just being realistic. Observing. Comparing. That's normal. Everyone compares. And comparatively, I'm doing fine. I'm doing great. I'm... I need to stop thinking about them. Why am I so focused on them? Why do I need them to be worse for me to feel okay? What does that say about me? Nothing. It says nothing. I'm fine. They're a mess. That's just facts.*

---

## 20. THE INTELLECTUAL BYPASS
*You can explain the psychology, the pattern, the problem. You understand it completely. But you're not actually processing it emotionally. Knowledge without integration.*

**Example: Understanding your trauma without feeling it**

*I know exactly what happened. I can trace it back. Childhood attachment issues. Inconsistent parenting. Developed anxious attachment style. Leads to relationship patterns where I seek validation, fear abandonment, self-sabotage. I've read the books. Done the therapy. I understand the neuroscience. The psychology. The developmental stages. I can explain it perfectly. I can see the pattern clearly. I know why I do what I do. I know where it comes from. I know how it works. And yet... I stilldo it. Because knowing isn't healing. Understanding isn't processing. I've intellectualized my trauma so thoroughly that I don't actually feel it anymore. I've turned my pain into a case study. My life into a psychological profile. I can analyze myself endlessly. Explain myself perfectly. But I can't actually change. Because I'm living in my head. I'm thinking about my feelings instead of feeling them. I'm studying my pain instead of processing it. I've made my healing into an intellectual project. And intellectual projects don't heal trauma. But at least I understand why. At least I can explain it. That's something. Right?*

---

## CONCLUSION

These states aren't linear. You don't progress through them in order. You can be in multiple states at once. You can cycle through them in a single day. You can live in one for years.

The point isn't to judge them. The point is to recognize them. To see yourself in them. To catch the voice in your head doing its thing.

Because once you can name the state, you can see it. And once you can see it, you have a choice. Not always. Not easily. But sometimes.

And sometimes is enough.
