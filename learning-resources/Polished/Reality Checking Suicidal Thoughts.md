## CORE TRUTH

You are not broken. You are in a **cognitive state** that produces distorted perception. This state:
- Feels like clarity but is actually restriction
- Generates certainty about things that are uncertain
- Makes temporary situations feel permanent
- Treats predictions as facts

**The state is real. The suffering is real. The thoughts are not reliable.**

Thisdocument helps you recognize when you're in this state and what to do about it.

## PATTERN LIBRARY

### PATTERN 1: TUNNEL VISION

**What it sounds like in your head:**
"There's only one way out. I've considered everything. This is the only solution that makes sense. I've thought about this carefully and logically."

**What it feels like in your body:**
- Chest tightness, like breathing through a straw
- Repetitive thought loops (same 3-4 sentences cycling)
- Time distortion (hours pass like minutes, or minutes feel like hours)
- Visual narrowing (literally harder to see peripherally)
- Can't imagine mundane future things (what you'll eat tomorrow, what you'll wear)

**What's actually happening:**
Your brain is in threat-response mode. When humans face perceived threats, cognitive resources narrow to focus on immediate survival. This feels like clarity because you're intensely focused, but it's actually **restriction of options**. Your brain has eliminated peripheral solutions not because they don't exist, but because threat-mode doesn't process them.

**The specific lie:**
"I've thought through everything" = You've thought through everything your current cognitive state allows you to process. That's a much smaller set than "everything."

**Reality check:**
- 6 hours ago, could you have predicted you'd feel exactly this way right now?
- If NO: Your certainty about the future is equally unreliable
- If YES: You've been in this state longer than you think (see Permanence Bias)

**Somatic marker check:**
Put your hand on your chest. Is your breathing shallow? Are you holding tension in your jaw? These are threat-state markers. Your body is telling you you're in altered perception mode.

**Immediate intervention:**
Don't try to think your way out. Thinking is compromised right now. Do something that breaks the physiological state:

1. **Cold water protocol**: Face in cold water for 30 seconds, or ice on back of neck. This triggers the dive reflex and interrupts threat response.

2. **Movement protocol**: 50 jumping jacks, or run in place for 2 minutes, or walk fast for 10 minutes. Intense movement shifts neurochemistry.

3. **Location protocol**: If inside, go outside. If outside, go inside. If in bedroom, go to kitchen. Physical location change interrupts state-dependent thinking.

**24-hour intervention:**
If immediate intervention doesn't shift the state:

Commit to 24 hours. Not forever. Not "getting better." Just: "I will not act on this for 24 hours."

Why 24 hours works: Suicidal states peak and trough. You're likely at or near a peak. 24 hours gives you one trough cycle. If it's truly permanent, it'll still be true tomorrow. But you're probably in a spike.

**When this pattern is most dangerous:**
- Late night/early morning (2am-5am)
- After prolonged isolation (more than 8 hours alone)
- After a specific triggering event (but hours later, not immediately)
- When you feel calm and certain (the dangerous clarity)

---

### PATTERN 2: PERMANENCE BIAS

**What it sounds like in your head:**
"This will never end. I can't survive feeling like this forever. The pain is permanent. This is just who I am now. It's always been this way."

**What it feels like in your body:**
- Heavy limbs (physical weight)
- Gray filter over vision (colors literally seem duller)
- Exhaustion that sleep doesn't touch
- "Always" and "never" dominating your vocabulary
- Can't access memories of feeling different (not just "I don't feel good now" but "I can't remember what good felt like")

**What's actually happening:**
You're experiencing **affective forecasting error**. Humans are terrible at predicting their own future emotional states. When you're in pain, your brain extrapolates that pain infinitely forward. But emotional states are cyclical by nature—even severe depression has fluctuations.

**The specific lie:**
"This is permanent" = This feeling is intense and present, therefore it will always be intense and present. But intensity of present experience doesn't predict duration.

**Reality check - The Timeline Test:**
- How long have you felt this exact way? (Be specific: days, weeks, months)
- Have you ever felt this way before?
- If YES: How long did it last then? It ended. You're here now.
- If NO: You have zero data about duration. You're predicting based on intensity, not evidence.

**The "Always" Audit:**
When you think "I've always been this way" or "It's always been like this":
- Define "always" in actual time units
- 3 weeks feels like always when you're in it
- 3 months feels like your entire life
- Check: Can you remember a specific day when you felt different? If yes, it's not "always."

**Somatic marker check:**
Stand up. Walk to a window or mirror. Look at your face. You look tired. That's not permanent—that's current state. Your face will look different tomorrow.

**Immediate intervention:**

1. **Temporal grounding**: Name today's date out loud. Name yesterday's date. Name what you did 3 days ago (anything, even "stayed in bed"). This breaks the "always" illusion.

2. **Micro-commitment**: Not "I'll feel better." Just: "I'll see what tomorrow morning feels like." You're not committing to hope. You're committing to data collection.

3. **State documentation**: Write down (or voice memo): "Right now I feel [X]. The time is [Y]." You're not arguing with the feeling. You're timestamping it. Later, this becomes evidence that states change.

**24-hour intervention:**
If the permanence feeling persists:

**The3-Day Rule**: Commit to 3 days. Not because you'll feel better, but because emotional states have natural fluctuation cycles of 48-72 hours. You're testing whether this is permanent or cyclical. If it's truly permanent, 3 days won't matter. But you're probably in a trough.

**When this pattern is most dangerous:**
- After multiple days of consistent low mood (the pattern itself becomes evidence)
- When you've stopped doing basic maintenance (showering, eating) because "what's the point"
- When you start giving away possessions or "getting affairs in order"
- When the exhaustion feels almost peaceful (dangerous acceptance)

---

### PATTERN 3: BURDEN NARRATIVE

**What it sounds like in your head:**
"Everyone would be better off without me. I'm just causing pain. My absence would be relief for them. They're only staying because they feel obligated. I'm a weight they're carrying."

**What it feels like in your body:**
- Shame heat (face flushing, chest tightness)
- Physical shrinking (hunched posture, making yourself smaller)
- Difficulty making eye contact (even imagining it)
- Nausea or stomach tension when thinking about specific people
- The specific weight of being "too much"

**What's actually happening:**
You're running a **simulation** of other people's internal experiences based on your current self-perception. But you're not them. You're projecting your self-judgment onto them and treating your projection as their reality.

**The specific lie:**
"They'd be better off" = You're predicting their grief response will be relief. But grief is not relief. Loss is not liberation. You're confusing "they won't have to deal with my problems" with "they won't have to deal with my absence."

**Reality check - The Direct Data Test:**
- Have you asked them directly: "Am I a burden to you?"
- If NO: You're guessing. Your guess is based on your self-perception, not their experience.
- If YES and they said no: Believe data over feeling. Your brain is in a state that rejects positive data.
- If YES and they said yes: That's about a specific situation/behavior, not your existence.

**The Funeral Simulation Error:**
You're imagining your funeral and people feeling relieved. But:
- You're imagining their initial reaction, not the years after
- You're imagining them without you, not them with your death
- You're not accounting for guilt, trauma, grief complexity
- You're assuming they experience your absence the way you experience your presence

**Somatic marker check:**
Think about a specific person. Notice where you feel it in your body. That physical sensation is YOUR shame/fear, not data about THEIR experience.

**Immediate intervention:**

1. **The Specific Evidence Protocol**: 
   - Text someone: "Can you tell me one specific thing I did that mattered to you?"
   - Don't argue with their answer
   - Don't dismiss it as "they're just being nice"
   - Receive it as data

2. **The Reverse Simulation**:
   - Think of someone you love who struggles
   - Do you wish they didn't exist?
   - If NO: Why would they feel differently about you?
   - Your brain is applying different rules to yourself

3. **The Obligation Test**:
   - If people only stayed out of obligation, they'd do the minimum
   - Have they done more than the minimum?
   - Specific examples: extra texts, checking in, remembering details
   - Obligation doesn't generate specificity

**24-hour intervention:**
If the burden feeling persists:

**The Impact Inventory**: Write down (or mentally list) every interaction you've had in the past week where someone:
- Initiated contact with you
- Laughed at something you said
- Asked your opinion
- Shared something with you
- Chose to spend time with you when they had other options

These are data points. They don't feel like data because your brain is filtering for burden-evidence. But they're real.

**When this pattern is most dangerous:**
- After a specific conflict or perceived failure
- When you're isolating (less data to contradict the narrative)
- When you're comparing yourself to others (especially on social media)
- When people are genuinely stressed (you attribute their stress to you)
- When you've recently needed help (asking for help feels like proof of burden)

---

### PATTERN 4: ESCAPE LOGIC

**What it sounds like in your head:**
"I don't want to die, I just want the pain to stop. Death is peace. It's not about wanting to end my life, it's about wanting relief. I just want to rest. I'm so tired."

**What it feels like in your body:**
- Bone-deep exhaustion (not just tired, but tired of being tired)
- Physical pain that has no clear source
- Heaviness in chest, like breathing through water
- The specific feeling of "I can't do this anymore"
- Sleep sounds appealing not as rest but as escape

**What's actually happening:**
Your brain is offering you a **category error**. It's treating death as a state you'll experience (peaceful, relieved, resting) rather than cessation of experience. This is your brain trying to solve the problem of suffering using the only framework it has: changing states.

**The specific lie:**
"Death is peace" = You're imagining death as a feeling-state (peaceful) that you'll experience. But there's no "you" to experience it. You're not seeking peace—you're seeking non-existence. These are not the same thing.

**Reality check - The Experience Paradox:**
- What you want: To stop suffering
- What death provides: Cessation of experience
- The gap: You can't experience relief from suffering if you don't exist to experience it

When you imagine death as peaceful, you're imagining yourself experiencing peace. But that's not death—that's a different life state.

**The Exhaustion Distinction:**
"I'm tired" has two meanings:
1. I'm tired and need rest (solvable with sleep/break)
2. I'm tired of the situation (solvable with change)

Death doesn't solve either. It eliminates the experiencer, not the tiredness.

**Somatic marker check:**
Where do you feel the exhaustion? Muscles? Head? Chest? That's real physical depletion. Your body needs resources (sleep, food, water, movement), not cessation.

**Immediate intervention:**

1. **The 10-Minute Protocol**:
   - Not "how do I fix my life"
   - Just: "What would make the next 10 minutes more bearable?"
   - Do that thing (water, different room, music, silence, lying down)
   - Then reassess
   - You're not solving forever, just the next 10 minutes

2. **The Rest vs. Escape Distinction**:
   - Actual rest: Sleep, lying down, closing eyes, quiet
   - Escape: Permanent solution to temporary depletion
   - Test: "If I could sleep for 12 hours and wake up with this situation unchanged, would that help?"
   - If YES: You need rest, not death
   - If NO: You need situation change, not death

3. **The Pain Localization**:
   - What specifically hurts right now?
   - Physical pain? (addressable with medical care)
   - Emotional pain? (addressable with support/time)
   - Existential pain? (addressable with meaning-making)
   - Name it specifically. "Everything" is not specific.

**24-hour intervention:**
If the escape logic persists:

**The Depletion Audit**: 
- When did you last eat a full meal? (not snacks, a meal)
- When did you last sleep more than 6 hours?
- When did you last move your body intentionally?
- When did you last have a conversation longer than 5 minutes?

Depletion mimics existential crisis. Your brain can't distinguish "I'm depleted" from "life is unbearable" when resources are low.

**Forced resource protocol**: Even if you don't want to:
- Eat something with protein
- Drink 16oz water
- Sleep (or lie down for 30 minutes)
- Reassess after

**When this pattern is most dangerous:**
- After prolonged stress with no breaks
- When you're running on empty (skipping meals, poor sleep)
- When you're in chronic pain (physical or emotional)
- When "rest" has become associated with "giving up"
- Late at night when exhaustion peaks

---

### PATTERN 5: ISOLATION REASONING

**What it sounds like in your head:**
"No one understands. I'm completely alone in this. Talking won't help because they can't fix it. They'll just say the same useless things. I can't burden them with this. They have their own problems."

**What it feels like in your body:**
- Physical sensation of being behind glass (can see others but can't reach them)
- Throat tightness when thinking about talking
- Chest hollowness (empty space where connection should be)
- Exhaustion at the thought of explaining
- The specific loneliness of being surrounded by people

**What's actually happening:**
You're conflating **understanding** with **perfect understanding**, and **helping** with **fixing**. Your brain is setting an impossible standard (complete understanding, total solution) and using the impossibility as evidence that connection is pointless.

**The specific lie:**
"No one can understand" = True. No one can have your exact experience. But you're treating "can't fully understand" as equivalent to "can't help at all." These are not the same.

**Reality check - The Understanding Spectrum:**
- Perfect understanding: Impossible (no one has your exact brain/history/context)
- Sufficient understanding: Possible (enough to be present, to care, to help)
- No understanding: What you're claiming, but not actually true

Have you ever helped someone without fully understanding their situation? If yes, why can't theydo the same for you?

**The Fixing Fallacy:**
You're right that talking won't fix it. But:
- Connection doesn't require fixing
- Presence doesn't require solutions
- Being witnessed reduces isolation even when problems remain

**Somatic marker check:**
Imagine telling someone what you're experiencing. Notice the throat tightness, the chest constriction. That's not evidence they can't help—that's your fear of vulnerability.

**Immediate intervention:**

1. **The Minimal Disclosure Protocol**:
   - You don't have to explain everything
   - Text someone: "I'm having a really hard time. Can you just talk to me about anything?"
   - Let them carry the conversation
   - You're not asking them to fix you, just to be present

2. **The Crisis Line Reframe**:
   - 988 (US) or your country's crisis line
   - You don't have to be "suicidal enough" to call
   - You don't have to have a plan
   - "I'm struggling and need to talk" is sufficient
   - They're trained for this exact state

3. **The Burden Reframe**:
   - Think of someone you love
   - If they were in crisis, would you want them to tell you?
   - If YES: They feel the same about you
   - If NO: Why are you applying different rules to yourself?

**24-hour intervention:**
If isolation persists:

**The Connection Experiment**:
Reach out to 3 people with a specific, low-stakes request:
- "Can you send me a photo of something that made you smile today?"
- "What's one thing that went right for you this week?"
- "Can you recommend a song/show/article?"

You're not asking for help. You're testing whether connection is possible. Most people will respond. That's data.

**The Parallel Play Protocol**:
If talking feels impossible:
- Be in the same space as someone (even virtually)
- Do separate activities
- No conversation required
- Physical proximity breaks isolation even without interaction

**When this pattern is most dangerous:**
- After multiple days alone
- When you've convinced yourself you're "protecting" others by not reaching out
- When you've had bad experiences with previous help-seeking
- When you're comparing your situation to others' ("they have real problems")
- When isolation has become comfortable (dangerous adaptation)

---

### PATTERN 6: CERTAINTY ABOUT UNCERTAINTY

**What it sounds like in your head:**
"I know how this ends. I can see the future clearly. There's no hope. I've tried everything and nothing works. This is just reality—I'm finally seeing things as they are."

**What it feels like in your body:**
- Calm certainty (the dangerous kind)
- Relaxation after decision (relief that feels like clarity)
- Clear-headedness (after days/weeks of confusion)
- The specific feeling of "finally understanding"
- Peace that comes from having "figured it out"

**What's actually happening:**
Your brain is in a state that **generates certainty**, not perceives truth. When humans are in crisis, the brain often produces a sense of clarity and calm once a decision is made—any decision. This feels like wisdom but is actually resolution of cognitive dissonance.

**The specific lie:**
"I'm thinking clearly for the first time" = You're in an altered state that produces the feeling of clarity. Actual clarity doesn't require crisis to achieve.

**Reality check - The Prediction Audit:**
- 1 year ago, did you predict you'd be exactly here today?
- If NO: Your long-term predictions are unreliable
- If YES: You've been in this state longer than you think (see Permanence Bias)

**The Certainty Paradox:**
- When you're actually thinking clearly: You can hold multiple possibilities
- When you're in altered state: Only one possibility seems real
- True clarity includes uncertainty. False clarity eliminates it.

**The "Tried Everything" Test:**
List what you've actually tried:
- How many different therapists? (1-2 is not "everything")
- How many different medications? (if applicable)
- How many different coping strategies?
- For how long each? (2weeks is not a sufficient trial)

"Everything" usually means "the3-4 things I had energy to try."

**Somatic marker check:**
That calm certainty? That's not peace—that's your nervous system shutting down after prolonged activation. It's the exhaustion after a fight, not the wisdom after reflection.

**Immediate intervention:**

1. **The Decision Postponement**:
   - You feel certain now
   - Certainty that's real will still be real in 2 weeks
   - Certainty that's state-dependent will shift
   - Set a specific date: "I'll revisit this decision on [DATE]"
   - If it's true now, it's true then

2. **The Altered State Recognition**:
   - How long have you been in crisis mode? (days, weeks)
   - Have you slept normally?
   - Have you eaten normally?
   - Are you in physical pain?
   - These are altered state markers. Decisions made in altered states have high error rates.

3. **The Outside Perspective Test**:
   - If a friend described your exact situation and said they were certain suicide was the answer, would you agree?
   - If NO: Why are you applying different standards to yourself?
   - If YES: You're in the same altered state, not seeing clearly

**24-hour intervention:**
If certainty persists:

**The Falsification Test**:
What evidence would prove you wrong?
- If you can't think of any: That's not certainty, that's closed thinking
- If you can think of some: Test it before acting

**The State Documentation**:
Write down your current certainty and reasoning. Date it. Put it away. In 2 weeks, read it again. If it still seems true, you have more data. If it seems like it was written by someone else, you were in an altered state.

**When this pattern is most dangerous:**
- After making the decision (the calm after the storm)
- When you're tying up loose ends or saying goodbyes
- When you feel peaceful and resolved
- When you're certain others will understand/agree after
- When the certainty comes after prolonged confusion (relief of resolution)

---

### PATTERN 7: COMPARATIVE SUFFERING

**What it sounds like in your head:**
"Other people have it worse. I don't have a right to feel this way. My problems aren't real problems. I'm just weak. People survive worse than this—what's wrong with me?"

**What it feels like in your body:**
- Shame heat (face, chest)
- Throat constriction when thinking about asking for help
- Physical shrinking (making yourself smaller)
- Tension from holding it in
- The specific feeling of "I don't deserve to struggle"

**What's actually happening:**
You're using **comparative suffering** to invalidate your own experience. But pain isn't a competition. Your suffering doesn't require justification through comparison.

**The specific lie:**
"Others have it worse, therefore my pain isn't real" = Suffering isn't relative. A broken leg doesn't stop hurting because someone else has two broken legs.

**Reality check - The Comparison Trap:**
- Can you think of someone who has it better than you?
- If YES: Does that make your pain more valid?
- If NO: Then why does someone having it worse make your pain less valid?

The logic doesn't work in either direction.

**The Permission Fallacy:**
You're waiting for your suffering to be "bad enough" to deserve help. But:
- There's no threshold
- You don't need permission to struggle
- "Not as bad as it could be" doesn't mean "not bad"

**Somatic marker check:**
Your body is in pain. That pain is real regardless of whether someone else's pain is "worse." Your nervous system doesn't do comparative analysis.

**Immediate intervention:**

1. **The Validity Statement**:
   Say out loud: "My pain is real. I don't need to justify it."
   You don't have to believe it. Just say it. You're countering the comparative script.

2. **The Threshold Reframe**:
   - You don't have to be "suicidal enough" to get help
   - You don't have to be "depressed enough" to reach out
   - "I'm struggling" is sufficient
   - Crisis lines, therapists, friends—none require you to prove your pain

3. **The Weakness Reframe**:
   - Struggling doesn't mean weak
   - Needing help doesn't mean failure
   - Your brain is in a state that requires support
   - That's biology, not character flaw

**24-hour intervention:**
If comparative suffering persists:

**The Compassion Test**:
- Think of someone you care about
- If they had your exact situation and said "I don't deserve help because others have it worse," what would you tell them?
- Apply that same logic to yourself
- You're not special in the opposite direction

**When this pattern is most dangerous:**
- When you're isolated (no reality check on your comparisons)
- After seeing others' struggles (social media, news, etc.)
- When you're from a background that emphasizes "toughness"
- When you've been told to "be grateful" or "think positive"
- When asking for help has been punished in the past

---

### PATTERN 8: THE PLAN AS COMFORT

**What it sounds like in your head:**
"I'm not going to do it right now, but it's good to know I have the option. Having a plan makes me feel better. It's my escape hatch. Just knowing I could makes the present more bearable."

**What it feels like in your body:**
- Relief when thinking about the plan
- Calm when reviewing details
- Reduced anxiety (paradoxically)
- The plan feels like control in an uncontrollable situation
- Comfort in having "a way out"

**What's actually happening:**
Your brain is using **suicidal ideation as an emotion regulation strategy**. The plan isn't actually about dying—it's about having a sense of control. But this is dangerous because the plan itself becomes reinforcing.

**The specific lie:**
"Having a plan helps me cope" = The plan is providing short-term relief while increasing long-term risk. You're training your brain to associate suicidal thinking with comfort.

**Reality check - The Function Test:**
- What does the plan give you? (control, relief, escape option)
- What else could give you those things?
- Control: What can you actually control right now?
- Relief: What else provides relief? (even temporarily)
- Escape: What situationdo you need escape from?

**The Reinforcement Trap:**
Every time you think about the plan and feel relief:
- You're strengthening the association
- You're making the plan more accessible
- You're increasing the likelihood you'll act on it
- The comfort is real, but the cost is high

**Somatic marker check:**
Notice the relief when you think about the plan. That's your nervous system responding to perceived control. But it's false control—you're not controlling the situation, you're planning to exit it.

**Immediate intervention:**

1. **The Plan Disruption**:
   - If you have a specific plan, introduce friction
   - Remove means if possible
   - Tell someone (this makes it harder to act)
   - Change one detail that makes it less accessible
   - You're not committing to living forever, just making impulsive action harder

2. **The Alternative Control**:
   - What can you actually control right now?
   - Your environment? (rearrange something)
   - Your body? (shower, change clothes)
   - Your immediate future? (plan the next hour)
   - Find real control, not exit control

3. **The Comfort Replacement**:
   - What else provides relief? (even if less intense)
   - Music, movement, cold water, talking, sleeping
   - You're not replacing the plan permanently
   - Just finding something else for the next hour

**24-hour intervention:**
If the plan remains comforting:

**The Disclosure Protocol**:
Tell someone about the plan. Not because they'll fix it, but because:
- Secrets have power
- Disclosure reduces the plan's grip
- Someone else knowing creates accountability
- You're not asking them to solve it, just to know

**The Function Replacement**:
- Control: Make a list of things you can control (small things count)
- Relief: Build a relief menu (10 things that provide any relief)
- Escape: Identify what you need escape from, find temporary escapes (not permanent)

**When this pattern is most dangerous:**
- When the plan is detailed and specific
- When you've rehearsed it mentally multiple times
- When you have means readily available
- When the plan provides more comfort than anything else
- When you're keeping the plan secret

---

## SPECIAL CASES

### "I've Been Here Before and Nothing Helped"

**What's true:**
- You've been in crisis before
- Previous interventions didn't prevent this crisis
- That's discouraging and exhausting

**What's also true:**
- You survived the previous crises (you're here now)
- "Didn't prevent this crisis" ≠ "didn't help at all"
- Different crisis, different context, different resources available
- Past performance doesn't predict future outcomes

**The pattern:**
Your brain is using past data to predict future impossibility. But:
- You're not the same person you were then
- The situation isn't identical
- What didn't work then might work now
- What didn't exist then might exist now

**What to do:**
- Acknowledge: Yes, you've been here before
- Distinguish: What's different this time? (anything, even small things)
- Try: One thing you haven't tried before (or haven't tried in this context)
- Lower bar: "Helped" doesn't mean "cured." Helped means "made it1% more bearable."

---

### "I'm Not Sure If I'm 'Bad Enough'"

**The threshold myth:**
There's no threshold. You don't have to be:
- Actively planning
- In immediate danger
- "Suicidal enough"
- Worse than you are

**What qualifies you for help:**
- "I'm struggling"
- "I'm having thoughts about not wanting to be alive"
- "I need support"
- That's it. That's the threshold.

**The comparison trap:**
You're comparing yourself to some imagined "real" crisis. But:
- Crisis is subjective
- Your pain is real regardless of intensity
- Asking for help early is smart, not dramatic

**What to do:**
- Call988 (US) or your country's crisis line
- Say: "I'm not sure if I'm in crisis, but I'm struggling and need to talk"
- They'll help you figure out what you need
- You're not taking resources from someone "more deserving"

---

### "I'm Worried About Burdening the Crisis Line"

**What crisis lines are for:**
- Exactly this
- People who are struggling
- People who aren't sure if they're "bad enough"
- People who just need to talk

**What crisis counselors signed up for:**
- Talking to people in crisis
- Helping people who are struggling
- Being present for exactly your situation

**The burden myth:**
- You're not taking them away from someone else
- They're there specifically for you
- Using a service you need is not a burden
- That's like saying going to theER with a broken bone is "burdening" the doctors

**What to do:**
- Call 988 (US) or your country's crisis line
- You don't need a script
- "I'm having a hard time and need to talk" is enough
- They'll guide the conversation

### "I Have a Plan and I'm Not Ready to Give It Up"

**What's true:**
- You have a plan
- The plan provides comfort/control
- Giving it up feels like losing your only option
- That's terrifying

**What's also true:**
- Having a plan increases risk
- The plan is providing false comfort
- You don't have to give it up forever
- Just for right now

**What to do:**

1. **Immediate:**
   - Tell someone about the plan (therapist, friend, crisis line)
   - Remove means if possible (or make them less accessible)
   - Commit to 24hours before acting

2. **Short-term:**
   - Work with someone to find alternative sources of control/comfort
   - Address what the plan is giving you (control, escape, relief)
   - Build other options

3. **If you're actively planning to act:**
   - Call988 immediately
   - Go to anER
   - Tell someone who can physically be with you
   - This is the moment to get help, not later

### "What If I'm Just Attention-Seeking?"

**The attention-seeking myth:**
If you're asking this question, you're not attention-seeking. People who are attention-seeking don't worry about whether they're attention-seeking.

**What's actually happening:**
- You need support
- You're afraid of being judged for needing support
- You're invalidating your own needs preemptively
- This is a defense mechanism, not reality

**The reframe:**
- Needing attention when you're struggling is appropriate
- "Attention" = connection, support, care
- Those are legitimate needs
- Asking for them is healthy, not manipulative

**What to do:**
- Notice the self-invalidation
- Ask for what you need anyway
- Let others decide if they want to give it
- Stop pre-rejecting yourself

## GROUNDING PROTOCOL
### (For When You Can't Think Straight)

**If you're flooded/panicking/can't focus:**

1. **Physiological reset:**
   - Cold water on face (30 seconds)
   - Or ice on back of neck
   - Or cold shower
   - This triggers dive reflex, interrupts panic

2. **Breathing (if you can):**
   - 4 counts in
   - 7 counts hold
   - 8 counts out
   - Repeat 4 times
   - (If this makes it worse, stop)

3. **Sensory grounding:**
   - Name 5 things you can see
   - Name 4 things you can touch
   - Name 3 things you can hear
   - Name 2 things you can smell
   - Name 1 thing you can taste

4. **Movement:**
   - Stand up
   - Walk to different room
   - Touch the wall
   - Feel your feet on the ground

5. **Then:**
   - Come back to thisdocument
   - Or call 988
   - Or text someone

## SUPPORTER GUIDELINES
### (For People Helping Someone In Crisis)

**What to say:**
- "I'm here. I'm not going anywhere."
- "You don't have to explain everything. I'm just here."
- "Whatdo you need right now? Even small things."
- "This sounds really hard. I'm glad you told me."
- "You don't have to be okay. You just have to be here."

**What not to say:**
- "It could be worse" (invalidating)
- "Just think positive" (not how brains work)
- "You have so much to live for" (creates guilt)
- "You're being selfish" (increases shame)
- "I know exactly how you feel" (you don't)

**What to do:**
- Be present (physically or virtually)
- Listen without trying to fix
- Ask directly: "Are you thinking about suicide?" (asking doesn't increase risk)
- If they say yes: "Do you have a plan?" (you need to know)
- If they have a plan: Get professional help involved (crisis line, therapist,ER)
- Remove means if possible
- Don't leave them alone if they're in immediate danger
- Follow up (text the next day, and the day after)

**What not to do:**
- Promise to keep it secret (you might need to get help)
- Try to argue them out of it (logic doesn't work in crisis states)
- Minimize their pain
- Make it about you ("I couldn't handle it if you...")
- Assume they're okay because they seem calm (dangerous calm is a thing)

**When to get professional help:**
- They have a specific plan
- They have means available
- They're saying goodbye or giving things away
- They seem suddenly calm after being in crisis
- Your gut says something is wrong
- You're not sure (when in doubt, get help)

**How to take care of yourself:**
- This is heavy. You need support too.
- Talk to someone about what you're experiencing
- Set boundaries if needed (you can care and have limits)
- You can't fix them. You can only be present.
- If they act on it, it's not your fault. You did what you could.

## FINAL NOTES

**Thisdocument is not:**
- A replacement for professional help
- A guarantee that you'll feel better
- A complete solution

**This document is:**
- A map of common thought patterns in crisis
- A set of tools for recognizing and interrupting those patterns
- A reminder that the state you're in is temporary even when it feels permanent

**The core message:**
Your brain is lying to you. The thoughts feel true because you're in a state that generates certainty. But feelings aren't facts. States aren't permanent. You don't have to believe you'll feel better—you just have to wait long enough to find out if you're wrong.

**Resources:**

- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** (US): Call or text 988
- **Crisis Text Line**: Text HELLO to 741741
- **International Association for Suicide Prevention**: https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/
- **Emergency Services**: 911 (US) or your country's emergency number

**If you're reading this:**
You're still here. That matters. Keep going.
