## **A Note on Radical Alternatives**

**What this is:**
A reframe for people experiencing suicidal ideation who still have enough mental space to consider alternatives. This is for the contemplation phase—when you're thinking about it, planning it, but haven't moved to action.

**What this is NOT:**
- A replacement for professional help
- Advice for someone in acute crisis (already decided, imminent risk)
- A cure for depression
- A judgment on anyone's choices or pain
- Clinical advice (this is one person's perspective—professional help remains the gold standard)

**If you're in immediate danger:**

**If you've already tried "everything":**
You might read this and think "I already did the radical change thing, didn't work." That's valid. This isn't claiming to be the answer—just offering a perspective that some people haven't encountered yet.

**If you can't access the "just change everything" option right now:**
That's the depression, not you. Executive function goes offline in this state. If this feels like one more thing you're failing at, ignore it. Come back if/when it might be useful. Or don't—this is just one perspective among many.

**The actual point:**
There's a possibility worth examining: that the thing you're trying to escape isn't existence itself, but this particular configuration of existence. For some people, seeing that distinction creates a pause. A pause is enough—enough to call someone, enough to wait one more day, enough to consider one option you hadn't seen before.

You don't have to figure out the whole rest of your life right now. You just have to not die today. Tomorrow you can decide again.

## **The Cosmic Joke**

You know what's wild? The person ready to end it has already done the hardest part. They've already accepted that everything they thought mattered doesn't. They've already let go of their old life, their old self, their old future.

They're just planning to throw themselves out with the trash.

---

## **The Logic Error**

"I can't keep living like this" → Correct!

"Therefore I should die" → Wait, how did we jump there?

You went from "this life is unlivable" to "all life is unlivable." That's not logic. That's just stopping too early.

---

## **The Reframe**

You're not trapped in life. You're trapped in THIS life. This specific configuration of choices, obligations, and identity.

You've already decided this version is unacceptable. You're just aiming at the wrong thing.

---

## **The Permission You're Not Using**

If nothing matters enough to keep living, then nothing matters enough to stop you from:
- Quitting the job
- Ghosting toxic people
- Moving somewhere random
- Changing everything
- Disappointing everyone
- Starting completely over

"But I can't do that!"

You were going to do something way more permanent. You were going to devastate everyone who cares about you.

But you "can't" quit your job? You "can't" let people down?

The math isn't mathing.

---

## **The Real Difference**

Death is one decision. Radical change is a thousand decisions.

Death is one moment of courage. Radical change is courage every day.

You're brave enough to die but not brave enough to:
- Disappoint your parents
- Abandon your career
- Start over at zero
- Live without a plan
- Exist without purpose
- Fail publicly

That's not bravery. That's just a different kind of fear.

---

## **The Actual Threat**

The real reason people choose death: it's certain.

Radical life change is uncertain. You might fail. You might end up worse. You might discover the problem wasn't your circumstances—it was you.

Death is the ultimate control move. "I can't control my life, but I can control my exit."

But if you're willing to accept the uncertainty of death, you can accept the uncertainty of radical change.

You're just choosing the uncertainty that requires less ongoing courage.

---

## **The Invitation**

You've already decided your current life is unlivable.

You've already accepted loss.

You've already grieved your future.

You were going to disappoint everyone anyway. You were going to break hearts anyway. You were going to leave anyway.

You just thought you had to leave existence entirely.

But you could just leave THIS. This job. This city. This identity. This version of yourself that's been suffocating.

---

## **The Truth**

The suicidal person and the radical revolutionary are the same person.

They've both decided the current situation is unacceptable.

They've both decided they'd rather risk everything than continue.

One just has better aim.

---

## **The Real Question**

Not "Am I brave enough to die?"

But: "Am I brave enough to live like someone with nothing left to lose?"

Because that person is free.

And freedom is way more interesting than nothing.

(If nothing feels interesting right now, that's the depression talking. The capacity for interest can return—it's just offline at the moment.)

---

## **If You're Still Reading**

You've already accepted the void. You're already willing to lose everything.

You just haven't realized you can lose everything and keep walking.

Same acceptance. Different direction.

You don't have to have a plan. You don't have to do it all at once. You don't have to do it "right."

Just don't die today. See what tomorrow looks like. Then decide again.

## **Resources Beyond Crisis Lines**

If this resonated and you want to explore alternatives:

**Immediate support:**
- Therapy (specifically DBT or CBT for suicidal ideation)
- Psychiatric evaluation (medication can change the neurochemical state that makes everything look hopeless)
- Peer support communities (r/SuicideWatch and other moderated spaces)

**If this didn't resonate:**
That's fine too. Different things work for different people. The fact that this particular reframe doesn't land doesn't mean you're out of options—it just means this wasn't your option.
