Tier Probes (fast, faithful localization)

T1 — The Stream of Awareness (Raw Input)
Probe: “Let’s capture raw inputs only—what sensations, thoughts, or observations are here before any conclusions?” 

T2 — Connecting the Dots (Initial Connections)
Probe: “What quick link are you making (Event A → Outcome B)? What’s the automatic prediction?” 

T3 — Using Your Mental Toolkit (Applying Models)
Probe: “What belief, rule, or tool are you applying to make sense of that connection?” 

T4 — Becoming the Mechanic (Metacognition)
Probe: “What pattern in your thinking do you notice, and is it still serving you? What would you test or change about that tool?” 

T5 — Seeing the Bigger Picture (Unitive Insight)
Probe: “Is there a higher-level context that integrates both sides? From a larger timescale, how does this change?” 

Use a single probe to find the current tier; acknowledge it before inviting a move to any other tier.

Common Stuck Patterns → Tool Selection (uses only patterns you name)
| Stuck pattern (from your doc) | Likely tier | Description                     | Tool (from Methods)                                                      | Where it operates  | Source |
| ----------------------------- | ----------: | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------ |
| **Emotional hijacking**       |          T1 | Raw emotion overwhelms thinking | **Temporal Shifting (10/10/10)**                                         | T4→T1 regulation   |        |
| **Autopilot loop**            |          T2 | Repetitive automatic links      | **Socratic Questioning**                                                 | T4 metacognitive   |        |
| **Analysis paralysis**        |          T4 | Endless examination, no action  | **Open Field → Goal Decomposition** (brief regulation, then a tiny step) | IPM→T3 integration |        |

 
 

Notes on tools (from your Methods index):

Temporal Shifting counteracts short-horizon urgency (Affective Modality) to disengage from HM and stabilize T1. 

Socratic Questioning is your primary T4 method to inspect assumptions driving T2 links. 

Goal Decomposition converts reflection into a small T3 plan once calm returns (especially after Open Field). 

Mini Acceptance Tests (operational, optional)

After Temporal Shifting: user names all 3 time horizons and self-reports intensity drop.

After Socratic: user states 1 assumption in clear T1 terms.

After Goal Decomposition: user commits to one ≤10-minute sub-task.

(Acceptance tests are implementation guidance—not derived from ILR wording.)
