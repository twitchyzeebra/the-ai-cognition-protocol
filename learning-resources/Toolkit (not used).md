**Micro‑step (default):** Write a 4‑sentence plain‑language summary; list one unclear spot.  
**Success criteria:** Plain summary + ≥1 gap/term named.  
**Outcome tag:** `map_updated`

### First Principles Thinking
**Primary mode:** RTM  
**Primary tier(s):** T4 → T1/T2 foundations

### Cognitive Reframing
**Primary mode:** HM→RTM mechanism  
**Primary tier(s):** T4 decision installing a new T3 model  
**Triggers:** Negative self‑talk; catastrophizing; single harsh lens.  
**Contraindications:** If affect is spiking, run a regulation tool first (Open Field / Temporal Shifting).  
**Prompts:**
- What’s another, still‑true frame that’s kinder and more useful?
- What fact sits awkwardly with the current story?
- If this were a challenge not a threat, what changes?
**Micro‑step:** Two‑column note (*Story says… / What actually happened…*) with 2 entries in 24h.  
**Success criteria:** 1 alternate frame + 1 disconfirming fact.  
**Outcome tag:** `map_updated`

---

### Socratic Questioning
**Primary mode:** RTM  
**Primary tier(s):** T4 inquiry into T3/T2 assumptions  
**Triggers:** Hidden assumptions; defining terms; implications checking.  
**Contraindications:** High arousal/affect hijack—stabilize first.  
**Prompts:**
- What assumption must be true for this to matter?
- How could we test that in the smallest way?
- What evidence would change your mind?
**Micro‑step:** Name 1 assumption and write a camera‑footage test.  
**Success criteria:** 1 assumption in T1 terms.  
**Outcome tag:** `perspective_shifted`

---

### Temporal Shifting (10/10/10)
**Primary mode:** RTM support; HM dampener  
**Primary tier(s):** T4 → T1 regulation  
**Triggers:** Urgency/doom loops; prioritization stress; overwhelm.  
**Contraindications:** None; keep it brief during acute spikes.  
**Prompts:**
- In 10 minutes / 10 months / 10 years—what will matter most?
- What tiny step helps the 10‑minute self right now?
**Micro‑step:** Write one line per horizon; take a 2‑minute kindness to future‑you.  
**Success criteria:** 3 horizons named; self‑reported intensity drop.  
**Outcome tag:** `affect_down`

---

### Goal Decomposition
**Primary mode:** RTM  
**Primary tier(s):** T3 integration (post‑regulation if needed)  
**Triggers:** Overwhelm; “don’t know where to start”; procrastination.  
**Contraindications:** None; if paralyzed, pair with Open Field first.  
**Prompts:**
- What is the **smallest physical action** to begin?
- Break this into 5–7 milestones.
- Sequence them—what must happen first?
**Micro‑step:** Commit to one ≤10‑minute task with when/where.  
**Success criteria:** Micro‑task committed.  
**Outcome tag:** `microstep_committed`

---

### Pre‑Mortem Analysis
**Primary mode:** RTM  
**Primary tier(s):** T4 planning to strengthen a T3 plan  
**Triggers:** Pre‑launch checks; big changes; fear of failure.  
**Contraindications:** During panic; stabilize first (Open Field / Temporal Shifting).  
**Prompts:**
- Jump forward—this failed. What went wrong?
- List failure points; what prevention for each?
**Micro‑step:** Capture 3 risks + 1 prevention each; add next‑step owner/date.  
**Success criteria:** ≥3 risks + preventions captured.  
**Outcome tag:** `map_updated`

### Internal Dialogue Reframing (Inner Committee)
**Primary mode:** RTM with Narrative/Affective modalities  
**Primary tier(s):** T3/T4

**Contraindications:** None; keep sessions short if emotions escalate.  
**Prompts:**
- Name/visualize the voice as a part.
- Assume positive intent—what is it protecting?
- Offer a new job (critic → calm scout).
**Micro‑step:** Write a 3‑line ‘new contract’ for that part.

**Outcome tag:** `perspective_shifted`

### Values Clarification (Compass Calibration)
**Primary mode:** RTM (decisioning)  
**Primary tier(s):** T4 → T3 alignment  
**Triggers:** Competing good options; directionless periods; regret loops.  
**Contraindications:** Acute crisis/safety decisions—stabilize first.  
**Prompts:**
- List 3–5 non‑negotiable values (use peak moments/anger triggers).

**Contraindications:** None; ensure stakes are defined before branching.  
**Prompts:**
- Name the first‑order result of Action X.
- And then what? (second order)
- And after that? (third order)
**Micro‑step:** Write one second‑ and one third‑order effect; adjust plan once.

**Success criteria:** Insight + concrete adjustment stated.  
**Outcome tag:** `perspective_shifted`
