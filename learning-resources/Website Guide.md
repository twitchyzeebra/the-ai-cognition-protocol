# Welcome to the AI Cognition Protocol

This guide will help you get started with the application and understand its core features.

## üöÄ Getting Started: Setting Up Your API Key

To communicate with the AI models, the application needs an API key. You have two options:

#### Using the Provided Key (For Testing Only)

By default, a temporary testing key for the Mistral large model is provided. Please be aware that this key is for initial trials and you will frequently encounter the error "Error: Rate limit exceeded. Please wait a moment before trying again." The key will be removed soon, likely to be replaced with a subscription based model featuring a free tier. At this point, I highly recommend using your own key which will always be supported.

#### Using Your Own API Key (Recommended)

You can bring your own key from a supported AI provider (Other providers coming soon‚Ñ¢). This gives you direct control over your usage and access to different models.

1.  **Obtain a key from one of the following providers:**
    *   **Google Gemini:**
        *   Get your key at: **[aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)**
        *   *(As of 19/08/25, Google provides a generous free tier for the Gemini 2.5 Pro model with a Google account.)*
    *   **Mistral AI:**
        *   Get your key at: **[console.mistral.ai/api-keys](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys)**
        *   *(As of 19/08/25, Mistral offers a free key with a very generous usage allowance with an account.)*

2.  **Configure your key in the application's sidebar.** Once you have your key, open the settings panel in the sidebar to enter it and select your desired model.

## üß† Understanding the AI System Prompts

This application allows you to choose from several distinct AI system prompts, each designed for a different type of analysis.

*   **Modes**
    *   This is the primary and recommended system prompt. It uses a sophisticated framework to analyze human relationships, communication, and cognitive patterns, providing deep, structured insights.

*   **Modes Explain Simply + Modes Technical Explain Simply**
    *   They are functionally identical to their respective documents, with the addition of "Delivery: Explain to the user simply". 

*   **Modes Technical**
    *   A highly detailed and technical version of "Modes". This is designed for researchers or advanced users who want to see a complex analysis.

*   **Tiers**
    *   This focuses on analyzing a situation through distinct "Tiers of Cognition"‚Äîfrom raw, uninterpreted data (T1) all the way to deep, synthesized insights (T5). It provides a layered breakdown of the thinking process.

*   **Default**
    *   A standard, helpful AI assistant without any specialized cognitive framework. This is useful as a baseline for comparison.

## üîí Privacy and Data Management

Your privacy and data control are paramount.

*   **Serverless Architecture:** Your prompts are sent directly from your browser to the AI provider you select (e.g., Google or Mistral). No intermediate server logs or stores your conversations.
*   **Local Storage:** All your chat history and settings are stored exclusively on your own computer in your local storage.
*   **Full Control:** You can permanently delete all your locally stored data at any time using the `Reset Application State` button in the sidebar.
*   **Portability:** You can easily back up your conversations by downloading them, or import previous chats from a file.

## ü§ù Connect & Support
